For example, imagine your application is able to export a user's data to a CSV file and email it to
them. However, creating this CSV file takes several minutes so you choose to create and mail the CSV
within a queued job. When the CSV has been created and mailed to the user, we can use event broadcasting
to dispatch a App\Events\UserDataExported event that is received by our application's JavaScript.
Once the event is received, we can display a message to the user that their CSV has been emailed to
them without them ever needing to refresh the page.

Broadcasting your Laravel events allows you to share the same event names and data between your
server-side Laravel application and your client-side JavaScript application.
